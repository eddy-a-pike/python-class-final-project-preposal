# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Eddy Pike WarioWare Clone

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be to recreate my version of WarioWare.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is to recreate a typical WarioWare stage. There will be a few (ideally at least 6) different simple minigames chosen at random for the player to do. 
One minigame might require the player to press one button multiple times. Another might have a player move a character to specific points on a grid.
If the player wins a minigame, their score rises by one. If they fail, they lose one of their lives (They would start out with 4 lives). If there
is time, I might also try to implement the "Speed Up!" mechanic from the series, which increases how fast the minigames will be and how little time
there will be to complete them. Or I can try to implement the "Level Up!" mechanic, which increases the difficulty of the minigames.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I do not plan to combine this course's final project with another course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am currently not planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to accomplish programming at least the minigames first. 6 different minigames that are all incredibly simple sounds like a good number to aim for, and 
it would be at least a proof-of-concept.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I can probably implement the lives system as well as the points system from the original WarioWare series into my project. So overall, I would have
a game that can choose a minigame to play at random and keep track on whether or not the player succeeds. If the player wins the minigame, the game would
give them 1 point, and if they lose the minigame, the game would take away one of the player's lives, which starts out at 4 lives. If the player runs out of
lives, the game ends.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to either implement the original WarioWare series' "Speed Up" mechanic, which increases the speed at which the minigames go, or to implement
the series' "Level Up" mechanic, which increases the difficulty of every minigame. I probably won't be able to implement both of these, but the "Level Up" mechanic
sounds easier to program.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I would have to research how to program a game in Python, and use that research to create one incredibly simple minigame. For example, a minigame that
lets you win if you press the spacebar 8 times in a row. From there, I can probably create other minigames, all of which are as simple, but some being only slightly
more ambitious (like a game that has a maze for you to navigate to get to a specific point). From there, I would need to research how to make it so that
instead of having several different games, I would have one game that randomly selects from the numerous different other minigames to play. And then from there
I could implement the lives and points system. If I wanted to implement the aforementioned "Speed Up" mechanic, I would have to find a way to increase the speed
of which the games run.
